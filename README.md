### What I learned

This was a challenging experience because I was able to use many new techniques that I hadn't used before. I tried to always use something new to solve a problem or to accomplish a task in a different way than I had before. Only to feel challenged and expand my knowledge. Even while doing simple things that I previously took for granted, I sometimes got stuck for hours before discovering that just one line of code would solve the problem. It's always interesting to use new techniques in programming.

### Useful resources

- [ChatGPT](https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt/) - This helped me to discover and use a lot of things that I was not used to. Even when I got some wrong responses or out of date information, I was able to extract something that helped me to finish or advance in a feature. It's an amazing tool for a student when used well.
